# Online mapping

## Learning objectives

By the end of this practical you should be able to:

1. Create
2. 
3. 

## Introduction 

In this practical we are going to explore several ways of publishing your R code and outputs (including interactive plots) online.

## RPubs

One of the most straight forward publishing tools is RPubs. It takes an ```.Rmd``` and directly uploads it to rpubs.com --- all files are publically available on this website.

1. To start with you need to make a free account. Go to: https://rpubs.com/users/new and register

2. Create a new project in RStudio and open a new R Markdown file (File > New File > R Markdown)

3. You'll see that the file is automatically populated with some information, have a read through it then click the Knit icon (if you remember we covered this in [Knitting your output])...

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "500pt", fig.align='center', cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics('prac8_images/knitt.png') 
```

4. Let's make some changes to your ```.Rmd```. Delete all the text and code except from header inforamtion (that is enclosed by three dashes at the top of the file)

5. Insert a new code chunk (go back to [RMarkdown] if you need a refresher) and add some code of your choice from either a previous practical or your own work. As it's a new project you'll have to either copy the data into your project folder or set the working directory ```setwd()```. If it's all online data that you've loaded directly from the web into R, this shouldn't be an issue. I'm going to use the interactive map we made in practical 5 (the [Advanced interactive map] section)..I have copied the.....Here is the code i've put in my chunk:

```{r, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(leafpop)
library(leaflet)
library(tmaptools)
library(tidyverse)
library(plyr)

OSM <- read_shape("data/gis_osm_pois_a_free_1.shp",as.sf = TRUE)

Londonborough <- read_shape("data/London_Borough_Excluding_MHW.shp",as.sf = TRUE)

Airbnb <- read_csv("data/listings.csv")
  
# plot xy data
Airbnb <- st_as_sf(Airbnb, coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), 
                   crs = 4326)

# reproject
OSM <- st_transform(OSM, 27700)
Airbnb <- st_transform(Airbnb, 27700)
# we don't need to reproject Londonborough, but it 
# doesn't have a CRS..you could also use set_crs
# it needs to have one for the next step
Londonborough<- st_transform(Londonborough, 27700)

#select hotels only
OSM <- OSM[OSM$fclass == 'hotel',]
Airbnb <- Airbnb[Airbnb$room_type == 'Entire home/apt' &
                   Airbnb$availability_365=='365',]

# make a function for the join
# functions are covered in practical 7
# but see if you can work out what is going on
# hint all you have to do is replace data1 and data2
# with the data you want to use

Joinfun <- function(data1, data2) {
  # join OSM and London boroughs
  joined <- st_join(data1, data2, join = st_within)
  
  # count the number of hotels per borough
  countno <- as.data.frame(count(joined$GSS_CODE))
  
  # join the count back to the borough layer
  counted <-left_join(data2, countno, by=c("GSS_CODE"="x"))
  
  return(counted)
}

# use the function for hotels
Hotels <- Joinfun(OSM, Londonborough)

# then for airbnb
Airbnb <- Joinfun(Airbnb, Londonborough)

# now try to arrange the plots with tmap
breaks = c(0, 5, 12, 26, 57, 286) 

#change the column name from freq for the legend
colnames(Hotels)[colnames(Hotels)=="freq"] <- "Accom count"


#join data
ti<-st_join(Airbnb, Hotels)
ti<-st_transform(ti,crs = 4326)

#remove the geometry for our pop up boxes to avoid
#the geometry field 
ti2<-ti
st_geometry(ti2)<-NULL
popairbnb=popupTable(ti2, zcol=c("NAME.x", "GSS_CODE.x", "freq"))
pophotels=popupTable(ti2, zcol=c("NAME.x", "GSS_CODE.x", "Accom count"))

tmap_mode("view")

# set the colour palettes using our previously defined breaks
pal <- colorBin(palette = "YlOrRd", domain=ti2$freq, bins=breaks)
pal2 <- colorBin(palette = "YlOrRd", domain=ti2$`Accom count`, bins=breaks)

map<- leaflet(ti) %>%
  
  # add basemap options
  addTiles(group = "OSM (default)") %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.Toner, group = "Toner") %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.TonerLite, group = "Toner Lite") %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron, group = "CartoDB")%>%
  
  #add our polygons, linking to the tables we just made
  addPolygons(color="white", 
              weight = 2,
              opacity = 1,
              dashArray = "3",
              popup = popairbnb,
              fillOpacity = 0.7,
              fillColor = ~pal(freq),
              group = "Airbnb")%>%
  
  addPolygons(fillColor = ~pal(`Accom count`), 
              weight = 2,
              opacity = 1,
              color = "white",
              dashArray = "3",
              popup = pophotels,
              fillOpacity = 0.7,group = "Hotels")%>%
  # add a legend
  addLegend(pal = pal2, values = ~`Accom count`, group = c("Airbnb","Hotel"), 
            position ="bottomleft") %>%
  # specify layers control
  addLayersControl(
    baseGroups = c("OSM (default)", "Toner", "Toner Lite", "CartoDB"),
    overlayGroups = c("Airbnb", "Hotels"),
    options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)
  )

# plot the map
map
```

6. Add some text at the start of your ```.Rmd``` you can include titles and subtitle using # followed by a space, a second level subtitle would be ##, and third ###

7. Save the file, Knitt it to HTML, this should be default and specified in the header --- enclosed by three dashes.

8. Once knitted you can easily publish the file to Ppubs using the Publish icon either in the viewer pane or the toolbar area (by run)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "300pt", fig.align='center', cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics('prac8_images/publish.png') 
```

Now how about adding a few design features...i've changed my header section to...

```{r eval=FALSE}
---
title: "publishexample"
output:
  html_document:
    theme: yeti
    smart: true
    highlight: textmate
    toc: true
    number_sections: true
    toc_float:
      collapsed: false
      smooth_scroll: true
---
```

9. Knit and then publish again...you'll notice a few aesthetic changes

## RMarkdown site generator 

RPubs are useful but what if you wanted to make a full site with different tabs for introduction, methodology, results and recommedations...one way is to use the RMarkdown site generator hosted on GitHub

RMarkdown site generator is useful as it does not require any third-party add ons like blogdown which is reliant on the hugo site generator

To make a site you'll need the following to be within your project:

(a) A configuration file with the filename ```_site.yml```

(b) A ```index.Rmd```

(c) Any other ```.Rmd``` files you want to create into pages on the site

For the site to work you only require (a) and (b)....but that would be a pretty boring site...

11. In your new project add a RMarkdown a file called ```_site.yml``` and one called ```index.Rmd``
